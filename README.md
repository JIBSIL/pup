# pup
üê∂ An upload frontend for Uppy. Allows for easy and fast uploads, in only HTML5 and JavaScript. This project provides a panel for Uppy, based on Tabler.

# What's different about this from Uppy?
- This packages Uppy, an open-source file uploader into Tabler, an open-source admin template.
- This is different from Uppy because it allows for a higher degree of access than is possible in Uppy
- This repo also provides some examples you can use for your own website
- If you use Tabler for your dashboard template, it's as simple as a drag and drop to add the widgets (pages) in this repository to your website!

This repository uses:
- [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for hosting
- [Tabler](https://github.com/tabler/tabler) for the dashboard template
- [Uppy](https://github.com/transloadit/uppy) for the uploader code
